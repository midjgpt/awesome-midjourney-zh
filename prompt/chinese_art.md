#### 设计一个古典咖啡杯
> Firstly, I chose traditional white porcelain as the material for the coffee cup because white porcelain has the characteristics of delicate texture and good light transmission, and it is also a traditional Chinese porcelain material.Secondly, I used deep blue as the main color. In traditional Chinese culture, deep blue symbolizes nobility, elegance, and calmness, which complement the temperament of coffee.Then, I designed the cup with landscape as the theme, using smooth lines to outline a beautiful landscape pattern, and creating a mountainous and undulating shape for the coffee cup, which not only has the charm of traditional Chinese landscape painting, but also has a modern sense.Finally, to highlight the ancient style, I added cloisonné to the mouth and handle of the coffee cup. Cloisonné was considered a luxury in ancient China and is a representative of court art, which, when paired with the texture of white porcelain, is even more elegant and noble,4K,--ar 9:16 --q 2 --v 5
